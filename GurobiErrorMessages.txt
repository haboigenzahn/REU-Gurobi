Error checking reminders in Gurobi:
Because their error messages are, by en lange, completely unhelpful

Missing constraint index:
	Trying to add multiple constraints when you are only adding one.
	Change addConstrs to addConstr

*not exact language	
Incompatible operator - cannot accept objects of type :generator or :none
	Adding a single constraint when you should be adding multiple.
	Change addConstr to addConstrs
	
KeyError
	Dictionary keys might not match. Might be imported/declared in a different order than called.
	
	Might be trying to call a dictionary key that has been filtered out by a subset operation.
	
	Keys are not part of a multidimensional array - instead of F[i][j][t] use F[i,j,t]

dict object is not callable (or tupledict object is not callable)
	Used () instead of [] to specify and index
	
TypeError: a float is required
	May have used .addVar instead of .addVars

Too Many Values to Unpack	
	Might be using a single value key but calling a tuple key
	
	NOTES	
For loops can be written outside of addConstr() completely (use singular)
for i in feeds:
	for l in brfs:
		model.addConstr()

... or they can be written after the rest of the equation, within addConstrs() (use plural)
model.addConstrs(F[i,j] >= quicksum(G[i,j,k] for k in depots) for i in feeds for j in hs)
